    <p>In the Yorkshire Dales National Park, UK, the ancient village of Gunnerside is brimming with English charm and history. Picture yourself strolling through its narrow lanes, surrounded by rolling hills, lush pastures and stone cottages, with the roar of the Swale River your only soundtrack. Designated in 1954, the national park is spread across 2,178 square kilometres, and there are over 1,000 farms in this area.</p>
